## Looking back 
 The most difficult part of this project was getting set up. To overcome this I was able to decipher the documentation and debug the code to get a better understanding. Coming to the actual algorithm I didn't have that much trouble as I was applying the knowledge I learned from my AI class at Rutgers.
